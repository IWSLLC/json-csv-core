[![Tests CI](https://github.com/IWSLLC/json-csv-core/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/IWSLLC/json-csv-core/actions/workflows/test.yaml)

Simple CSV export module that can export a rich JSON array of objects to CSV. 
This is a core project built for node AND browser. My goals here were to open up the audience for the predecessor package `json-csv`, which will still serve as the Node only extension of this one supporting features like Stream/Readable in Node.

This core library will focus on the buffered and single object -> CSV functionality.
